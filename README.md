# The repo for the pathmaker

## Requirements

Install `build-essential` and `libboost...`.


### Building

Run `cmake CMakeLists.txt` in the directory. Afterwards a simple `make` will be enough to place a freshly baked executable into the `bin/` directory.

Sometimes it is deemed useful to not forget how to use CMake: cmake -DCGAL_DIR=/usr/lib/CGAL/ for an ubuntu installation.

### Requirements for the interface that doesn't exist yet
Install qt-creator, qt-designer, libqt5svg5-dev and compile. Enjoy the ride!
