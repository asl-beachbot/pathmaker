# The repo for the pathmaker

This is part of the software for the [BeachBot](http://beachbot.ch)

## Requirements

Install `build-essential` and `libboost...`.

### Building

Run `cmake CMakeLists.txt` in the directory. Afterwards a simple `make` will be enough to place a freshly baked executable into the `bin/` directory.

### Requirements for the interface that doesn't exist yet
Install qt-creator, qt-designer, libqt5svg5-dev and compile. Enjoy the ride!
