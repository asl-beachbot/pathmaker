-- work priorities:

- Implement either something based on libspiro (ask Raph Levien again?) or
  use bezier and numerical analysis for the connection
- Segmentation with Holes?! Holes?!
- Implement all the tools
- Add non segmenting back and forth fill like custom segmentation (with is-inside detection) and TSP

--- less priority ideas ---

- something that drives on straight skeleton edges (in the tight strips)

-- DONE --

- Get TSP to work
	-- LOOKING GOOD
- Implement user interface for custom segmentation
- Get Spiral to run very good and predictable!
-- Works good, but needs to look for nearest point every time, otherwise artifacts!
